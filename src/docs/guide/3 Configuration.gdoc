There is only one configuration option for the plugin in addition to those used by the Cloud Foundry plugin, @requireLogin@ and like the others it is specified in Config.groovy:

{table}
*Property* | *Default* | *Meaning*
grails.plugin.cloudfoundry. requireLogin | @false@ | if @true@ then prompt the user at runtime for Cloud Foundry credentials rather than storing them in @cloudfoundry-ui.properties@
{table}
